Bounce Up! is a 2D game made using tmpl8 (https://www.3dgep.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TheTemplate.zip). 
In this game you will need to shoot your ball onto other balls which shoots your ball into the air.
Miss a ball and you will fall down into the lava. 
Make sure to aim fast or your timer will run out which makes you lose the game. 

The balls are inside a zone. Go too far out of the zone and there will be no more balls to bounce off.
- The green balls are neutral and will just bounce you into the air. 
- The red balls are dangerous an will kill you on impact!
- The golden balls will give you lots of points when bouncing off them!
- And the White balls will fully heal your timer.  

Controls is just your mouse. When clicking the mouse a line between the ball and mouse will appear, thats where you will be shooting at!
